# MPC
Code and an example for the MPC model

This repository contains all functions used for real data analysis to study multiple primary cancers (MPC) as in our manuscript, "Bayesian estimation of a semiparametric recurrent event model with application to the penetrance estimation of multiple primary cancers in Li-Fraumeni syndrome" (preprint available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06883).

We further provide example.R that simulates a small dataset and then calls the functions to run the MCMC algorithm. The resulting estimates are also provided for comparison.
