# MPC
Code and example for the MPC model

This repository contains all functions used for real data analysis to study multiple primary cancers (MPC) as in our manuscript "Bayesian estimation of a semiparametric recurrent event model with application to the penetrance estimation of multiple primary cancers in Li-Fraumeni syndrome" (preprint available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06883).

We further provide example.R that simulates a small family dataset and then calls the functions in order to estimate the parameters. The final estimates are provided for comparison.
